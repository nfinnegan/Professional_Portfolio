# Professional_Portfolio

## Project Overview
*Created a personal career portfolio website


## Description
*Using a combination of CSS and HTML I created a career portoflio to house future work/projects

The second week of bootcamp, we were focused on learning advanced CSS. I've taken some of the things I've learend inside & outside of class to build this out, mainly using flexbox and grids. Both the HTML & CSS were coded from scratch. 

All photos will eventually be clickable and be linked to future projects. At the moment to make sure it was coded correctly, I linked the Project 1 and Project 2 to www.google.com. My personal photo also links directly to my LinkedIn profile.
